Using Abalone Dataset: Build two models with nonlinearity methods
Predicting the age of abalone from physical measurements is a classic challenge in data science. The age, determined by counting the rings on the shell through a microscope, is a time-consuming and laborious process. A reliable predictive model based on easily obtainable measurements like length, diameter, and weight would offer a significant practical advantage. However, the relationship between these physical characteristics and age is not strictly linear; biological growth often follows more complex, curved patterns.
This report explores the application of non-linear modeling techniques to the abalone dataset. The goal is to build and compare different models that can capture these non-linearities, thereby improving predictive accuracy over simple linear regression. We will begin by exploring two common non-linear methods—polynomial regression and natural cubic splines—using a single predictor. We will then advance to a more comprehensive multivariate polynomial model that incorporates multiple predictors and their interactions, along with regularization to enhance stability. Through assumption checks and performance comparisons, this analysis aims to identify the most effective and statistically robust model for this task.
